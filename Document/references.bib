     Coronary Artery Centerline Extraction Algorithms},
  abstract = {Efficiently obtaining a reliable coronary artery centerline from computed
     tomography angiography data is relevant in clinical practice. Whereas numerous
     methods have been presented for this purpose, up to now no standardized
     evaluation methodology has been published to reliably evaluate and compare
     theperformance of the existing or newly developed coronary artery centerline
     extraction algorithms. This paper describes a standardized evaluation
     methodology and reference database for the quantitative evaluation of coronary
     artery centerline extraction algorithms. The contribution of this work is
     fourfold: 1) a method is described to create a consensus centerline with
     multiple observers, 2) well-defined measures are presented for the evaluation of
     coronary artery centerline extraction algorithms, 3) a database containing
     thirty-two cardiac CTA datasets with corresponding reference standard is
     described and made available, and 4) thirteen coronary artery centerline
     extraction algorithms, implemented by different research groups, are
     quantitatively evaluated and compared. The presented evaluation framework is
     made available to the medical imaging community for benchmarking existing or
     newly developed coronary centerline extraction algorithms.},
